[INST] Should I open a credit card when I turn 18 just to start a credit score? [/INST],"I would recommend opening a credit card. But first make sure you understand what you're doing. First, how will this affect your credit?  Opening credit card accounts in a short period of time is looked upon adversely and, therefore, will affect your ability to obtain credit for up to 2 years. Therefore, you want to spread out the opening of other accounts over a longer period of time before you open this one. Second, what other kinds of accounts are available to you?   Make sure that you shop around and are finding the best deal available.  It is very easy to spend money with a credit card and be surprised by the resulting interest owed. If you're getting the card with your debit card bank, make sure that the interest rates are very competitive and/or that there is no annual fee.  The APR on some debit credit cards varies from a minimum of around 9.99% to as high as 29%!  That's a very big difference. Another option is a Secured Credit Card.  It's a card that is secured with the funds in your checking or savings accounts.  The interest rates on this kind of card can be as low as 12.98%.  However, you're paying for that privilege. In the event that you don't pay your bill, they'll withdraw that same amount from the checking or savings account you used to secure it. In summary, opening an account is best for building your credit and securing your card is fine if you're planning on paying for every purchase and you need to build your credit. But before you decide, check the rates and find the best deal for your situation.","I would recommend having a credit card to help you establish credit, only if you can pay it off in full every month (i.e. only spend what you can afford.) Some cards have some really terrible interest rates, and you should avoid accruing extra interest.  Keep your credit utilization below 30%, and pay down any other debt you have and your credit will only go up.  If you get any other creditors (like a car payment, or any other major purchase), keep all of those accounts as positive as possible.  Once your score is at a decent level, start opening more accounts and then close them.  Also, keep your accounts, even if they have a high balance, open, and closed accounts are a factor. If you aren't worried about your future or your credit history, by all means, go and pay it off in full anyway, but make sure it's the right card for you.  You don't want an annual fee, which will negate any positive effect this card will have on your credit.  In the end, this is just more of a piece of advice that may or may not be needed, and one factor of many that makes up a credit score, which I, personally, find interesting. Good luck! :D"
[INST] Why do shareholders participate in shorting stocks? [/INST],"The purpose of a short sale is to sell a security without owning it, in hope of profiting on the price decrease, and closing the difference and pocketing the profit. To do this successfully one would need to have a margin account or a short selling (also a margin) account of which to borrow the shares.  And by ""borrow"", you're implying the actual number of shares exist somewhere, that in fact the other short sellers haven't sold them to you already and taken the money to go invest.  You'd also need to have a margin balance available to cover the interest that would have come due for the borrowed shares.  Otherwise they would not loan you the shares, as you would have a 100% margin balance and a short position all at the same time with no interest paid. Thus shareholders do not participate in short selling of security - it's not a free lunch they are giving you.","The shareholder lending the shares to the short seller does not need to accept those shares as collateral, that is he is not obliged to accept the shares as payment in the case of default.  His only financial risk is if the short seller fails to return the shares on the date of settlement  If he does return them then the shareholder is in the same position as they have the cash from the deal, so whether he has the shares or not, that is not relevant.   His only financial risk is if the stock price is below the strike price and the short seller does not make an interest payment. In return for lending the shares, the borrower pays a fee.  This fee is usually a % of the shares loaned (as % and not in cash).  Why should I take my cash and buy the shares back instead of doing what my customer does and sell and return the shares? If I'm the shareholder, I'd rather get the money and use it to buy better stock, or sell the shares to somebody else."
[INST] Why do card processing companies discourage “cash advance” activities [/INST],"It's because the credit card industry is trying to get away from being a credit provider to being a provider of ""payment"" solutions. The days of banks providing ""payment solutions"" are rapidly coming to an end, and the credit card industry is trying to take it's place. You see, by providing ""payment solutions"", people will use cards more, and as such it will cost more for people to pay for things using cards, and as such the credit card companies will have more money coming in. The problem with this business model as long as ""cash advances"" are allowed is that people can basically get around paying interest by just withdrawing money via ""cash advance"" from ATMs. Because it can take 1-2 billing cycles for the interest charges to hit your bill, you can basically end up with a ""free"" loan from your credit card company, and that is a problem for them - unless you actually pay off the ""cash advance"" before you are charged interest on it.","There are a few reasons but I assume one of the biggest reasons is that they will have to pay the merchant the processing fee without getting paid from the cardholder and then they have to send the cash to you. I can't think of anything else they will have to pay to other parties involved too, but that's one reason why cash advances are heavily discouraged. In some places, the card issuing bank can even charge $10 to $30 dollars and interest on cash advances and that will only further discourage this behavior."
[INST] Is dividend included in EPS [/INST],Dividends included in EPS. Net Income/Shares outstanding (Dividends paid) should result in a number less than the 'true' earnings per share since dividend is paid out.,"The EPS is the money that has been paid out to you (and therefore subtracted from your net worth) plus the money that would accrue to you at current market price. Consider Apple as an example: at the end of 2013, Apple had $12.24 per share, but if you were a shareholder, you would receive $18.41 per share. The price of your stock is your investment. You get to subtract the cost of that, and take a profit or loss based on whether the current price is above or below what the company is currently distributing to you. To sum up, the EPS includes the dividends paid. You can calculate the dividends yourself by calculating the current stock price. Here's a quick example from Apple's 2013 report:"
[INST] Where should I park my money if I'm pessimistic about the economy and I think there will be high inflation? [/INST],"There are funds such as HCM, which invests in tangible assets such as gold, silver and other commodities.   The idea is this:   If the value of the dollar declines/the dollar loses its value, the value of the investments in the fund should increase.   If this fund has performed poorly over the past few years, it might be because the dollar has been weak so this type of investing (a bet against the dollar) has not been profitable.","Inflation might not have been the best word to use. Inflation is used when the value of currency drops. What you meant was that you believe that we might move to some form of global currency, or that you believe that in general the national currency might weaken. A good bet might be a government-issued treasury bond. Most likely, a long-term one. Another option might be physical gold or silver."
[INST] Why would analysts recommend buying companies with negative net income? [/INST],"While there might be good reasons for the company to take on debt or be in a negative income generating situation, there are also some other reasons that such companies are undervalued or perceived to be undervalued. One such reason would be that the firm is considered to be a good opportunity for ""event driven investors"". While this may sound like a fancy way for calling these investors by a different terminology, such investors in general consider their investments based upon a certain news related to the company e.g. M&A, spin-offs, dividend, asset acquisition, etc. There are multiple studies of these investors. One such one done by G. Bamber, N. Ghose, S. Schmitt, and J. Yasuda that appeared in July 2007 (http://www.nber.edu/papers/w12911) found among other things that companies on the I-Banking buy-side list do not produce significantly better returns than the broad market once controlling for book-to-market and size do. It is also important to note that their sample period was from 1999 to 2004 and the study was done in the months preceding the crash of 2008. Such investors are not only more sensitive to the news and market noise but there has also been evidence that the ""quality"" of the news, as the companies themselves would like the investors to appreciate, such as analyst's recommendations have been found to have significantly less information of a positive nature than any other negative news item such as a management change, a reorganization, or a spin off.  One can safely say that analysts usually do not do a very thorough job at valuing debt or at least do not have the tools to see exactly under which scenario the company would start generating positive cash flow. One such piece of software that tries to solve the valuation problems of companies using debt is the ""net income"" feature on Dividend.sg (http://dividendsg.com). This is a tool the authors are working on over 6 years and it tries to address the valuation problems of companies that may look unattractive in their current state. The valuation is done based upon the company's historical operating cash flow and an ""estimate"" of the current operating margins, a scenario in which the operating margins would reach their historical average levels, etc.","There are a lot more things to make your decision to buy or sell a security then what the company is selling.   The bottom line is simply the point of many financial statements to summarize the financial position at a point in time.   These do not really illustrate any potential future earnings or trends.  The only thing that they do is demonstrate that they are at odds with the current accounting standards and will have to restate their earnings as such. I always consider any bottom line number as suspect.  The bottom line is never at the top of my checklist when making a buying or selling decision. There are many other statements that should be viewed before making any decision.  They include  Income Statements which show net income, cost of goods sold, sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, which all give potential investors a feel for the health of the company they want to invest in.   Balance sheets which show assets and liabilities as compared to the last period, showing how this affects the liquidity and solvency of a company, which in turn will provide a company to stay in business.   Cash Flow Statements which provide a comprehensive measure of cash available to the company and potential to the company. In my opinion, Net Income is one of the most misleading metrics of a company."
[INST] Why would people sell a stock below the current price? [/INST],"It could simply to the case that this particular person wanted to take their profit at that moment and doesn't necessarily want to wait, or that a big purchase of or sale of the stock just occurred somewhere downstream of the market's order book (say in another country's market that doesn't trade a lot compared to what's transacting in the US) and the price has to settle down the global market order for that particular stock.  In either case, it really doesn't change the company's value; the person selling doesn't care what the stock's price changes to afterwards other than as a measure of profit or loss, and the buyer buying it does care (although generally not as much as the seller), but neither of them have power over the price.",No shares on the market to sell.  If you have a million shares on the market and sell 100k now you still have 1 million shares but 200k less shares you expect to sell at a higher price.  This would drive up the price.  If you buy 100k your share price drops.  If you have too many shares to move in the block or can't find any at the price you are willing to pay you drop your bid.
[INST] Conservative ways to save for retirement? [/INST],"I think that the best way to save for retirement is with a tax sheltered retirement savings account. The one that fits in the US seems to be the Traditional 401(k) or IRA. You are allowed to make contributions to a 401(k), in most cases a percentage of your salary, and you won't have to pay income tax on that. I have a Solo 401(k) retirement account through Vanguard that is my main investment account and where I save for retirement. The minimum contribution, like most retirement vehicle, is low as it is based off of salary, so $50. I do contribute the max as the 401(k) plan is tax deductible. For example, this year I qualified for the maximum contribution of $18,000 which comes to around $1,498 a month. I contribute most of my earnings to the retirement account so I really don't notice any tax issues in my day to day finances. If I want to make a ""splurge"" purchase, I just pull money out of my non-retirement accounts such as a savings account. (Note, you can only fund your Traditional 401(k) and IRA by automatic payroll withdrawal or money market deposits. All of the best investment options are through funds and cannot directly accept deposits or withdrawals. If you have the money to invest and wish to direct into a stock exchange, you will need another account to act as a cash account to perform the buying and selling, and the money for that will be taxed as income.)

I will add that you should know what type of an index you are investing in, so you know the underlying investments you are putting your money into. Some options: https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/3775.pdf  https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/content/why_invest_why_index_funds.html  http://www.thebalance.com/index-funds-for-retirement-options-5005502   I am using Vanguard as an example here as they were my preferred choice at the time of this edit (due to their low costs and reputation) I am not in any way endorsing this particular company for you.  It's just that it will give you a general idea of what you can expect.  Do additional research if you choose to go a different route."
[INST] What should my finances look like at 18? [/INST],"It's good that you are trying to take control of your finances, but it looks like you are trying to plan the future on limited information. As 18 year olds we make grand plans. As we get older, we recognize that life has a way of changing (even as we try to stay resolute).  My personal philosophy is to plan for the ""what ifs"". I may plan to pay $1500 a month to live a ""certain lifestyle"", but I won't plan on always living that lifestyle.  I think you should set yourself up to not worry about money. You've listed income as one side of the balance sheet, which is great. However, you've neglected to note your expenses.  First, you should have a basic budget, noting living expenses (rent/mortgage, electricity, water, etc), transportation (car payment), debt obligation (student loans), and entertainment/recreation (everyone needs to have some enjoyment in life). These basic expenses will help you to see where you are right now, and that will help you start your first plan. The plan should take into account things like, how much do you want to make as an over-all income goal. Once you know your current monthly obligations, how much will you need to take in (assuming you plan to spend all of your take home pay on these items?) and then plan for savings. These are just a few of the things to consider. Some of these are necessary for any reasonable plan, others are more subjective, like how much to save. For example, should you pay of student loans before you start saving to buy a car, house, etc. It's tough to plan for what's going to be 10 years from now, so that's why I suggest focusing on today's needs and what to plan to accomplish in say 3-5 years.  Good luck, you are definitely on the right path.","The first thing I recommend is that you need to define your values. Why do you want to have the big paycheck? Do you do it for yourself, or for your family, friends or coworkers? If you want a big paycheck in life, and if you're willing to do the work, a college degree is probably the best tool you can get. You may find you get more satisfaction out of living well, rather than getting that big paycheck.  So the first thing I'd do is define your goals - what is most important to you in life? What do you want out of life? How do you want to live? How do you want to use your time and money? What do you want to accomplish? What do you want to share with your family, friends and others? What do you want to give back? What are you not willing to do? What will you sacrifice to achieve what is important?  Once you figure that out, you'll better understand your financial needs. Your next thought is what do I want in the short term? You're young and the future is much more important than the present. You don't know what you want in the future, that's OK. Start by writing down your goals - 2 month, 3 month, 6 months, a year, and then do a long term goals ( 2 years, and 5 years).  Now it's time to organize your finances by creating a plan: 1. Create a budget for 2 months and 6 months. A budget is a record of all your income and expenses. Start by making two budgets. One budget for 2 months and one budget for 6 months. List your expenses, starting with necessary things first. Rent is necessary, groceries is necessary, utilities are necessary, etc. Make sure you have a separate category for wants like eating out, movies, entertainment, etc. The important thing is to stay on track with your budget. You can be flexible with things until you hit your short term goals, then stick to your budget no matter what. 2. Look for passive income. How can you make money in the future that won't require work? Look for investments now. Pay attention to what your parents are doing, if you don't want to ask it may teach you what not to do in the future. In the short term you'll need to have a plan for managing your expenses every day. You could try creating a budget right now, see if you can stay on track with it for 2 to 3 months. Then update it as needed. There is one important piece you should keep from your parents - a savings account. 3. Start an emergency fund. You need to know what life without a job would be like, in case it happens. You want to save 6 months of your normal living expenses. This is not a savings account, it's an emergency savings account. Make it a high interest account so you can't use the interest to live off of for fun things. 4. Prepare for the future. You will have to retire someday. It might not feel like you need to save for retirement now, because what's another 40 years of work right? The reality is that social security won't support your current lifestyle when you retire. We don't know what social security will look like in 40 years, so preparing for retirement now will make your future much more comfortable. Do the math - how much do you need? Can you invest now and get 10% back? What can you save for the future, now? If you need to ask for help or advice you can read the book ""The Automatic Millionaire"" by David Bach. It's not the only book on the market, but it's a popular one and many people like reading it. 5. Learn about debt. Do you have credit card debt? If you had no debt right now where would that money be instead? Do you have any loans that you pay monthly? If you're lucky, those will get paid in less than 10 years and cost you less than $30,000. If you weren't paying back a debt right now, could you make more than $30,000? Can you make $1,000 a month, with no debt? 6. Buy life insurance. I recommend that everyone at least buy term life insurance. It's a big safety net in case of emergencies in your future. If you have to drop out of college, are you prepared to survive for your next 40 years? You need something to help your future lifestyle stay the same, if possible, or at least maintain the standard of living."
[INST] Alternative means of salary for my employees [/INST],"I would recommend talking to your accountant or your Payroll Service provider. I don't know the laws in Australia, but I do know that in the US salary and wages are subject to various taxes.  Payroll taxes which include social security, medicare and unemployment.  You also pay federal and state taxes on that income that the employees are paid. There are other taxes you pay, such as sales tax if you get reimbursed for business expenses.  If you sell goods, income tax on your sales, and more.  Every payment to employees costs you money.   Why is it important?  Because that money you are spending on the employee pays a salary, not an interest rate. The bank is charging an interest rate for the money you are using for the salaries and wages.  You owe an interest rate for using the money. If you pay cash from your own account, you are not paying bank charges.  Those charges, known as interest, is just additional costs to pass on from you as the bank, to the borrower.  A borrower is anyone that receives cash in exchange for performing services or providing goods.  You are borrowing cash from your savings account.  They are charging you interest for the funds you borrow. Why is it important to tell your accountant?  The government takes a look at your income, expenses and taxes.  They make assumptions on where that money is coming from and how the expenses are generated.  To get the correct tax deductions you need to show them the actual process so they can allocate the expenses properly. If you are giving your employees checks with money drawn from your business savings account, then you are paying cash for those services.  If the expenses are part of the business, then your accountant has to make sure the government is collecting the correct taxes.  When you use a Payroll Service, they automatically make sure the taxes get paid.  When you tell your accountant that you are paying $1000. The accountant assumes you are paying the employee $1000.  If you do that in an unrelated transaction, then the money gets classified differently.  This makes it difficult for the IRS to properly track your money when they are auditing your taxes. Your Payroll Service provider takes care of all of this for you.  They pay the taxes into the appropriate accounts for you.  It takes the stress away from you.  This allows you, as an entrepreneur, to focus on your business.","You can't make them be in this form.  If you would only like to pay them in this form then offer them a job for an ""independent contractor"" and not give them any benefits or insurance.  Or better yet make the minimum wage and then give them a 1099 instead of a W2 for a 1099 employee as the minimum wage should be for an IC. The only other option is to revert to paying them like you do now."
[INST] Why is it not a requirement for companies to pay dividends? [/INST],"There is no legal requirement for a company to pay dividends in the USA. However, the 1933 Act does require the company to meet certain standards before they can issue shares and sell stock to the public.  This act includes quarterly financial reporting standards and limits to the number of issued shares.  The issue of dividends would therefore fall under these standards as many companies are paying them quarterly too.  I know some companies used to pay dividends annually or semi-annually.  If they don't have a history of quarterly dividends, but the board of directors did declare an annual or semi-annual amount, this would have to appear on the books within six months after the appropriate quarter.  The Board of Directors and company would make other statements within the quarterly financial reports about paying dividends and their plan for this.  If a company chose to pay dividends, the process would be the same. As mentioned in another question, the Board of Directors determine the dividends.  They usually make this decision based on annual or quarterly reports.  There are legal and tax requirements in the USA (most states) that require a certain amount of assets to be available when dividends are declared.  However, even if no funds were available, the Board can still declare dividends with a ""withholding"" that is the amount of the funds that can be used to declare dividends within a time period.  The Board can also change their mind on declaring the dividends.","It is not a requirement, because the shareholders can decide to reinvest their dividends.  That means the company can keep money on their balance sheets instead of pay it out. It also means that if a dividend is paid out, there is a lower amount of free cash available to reinvest in the company or to buyout other businesses.   There's also a balance to be struck to not pay too much in dividends, to keep some in case other investments become available. There is also the need to keep some in case the market falls, because if a stock is priced low and then you pay out a dividend, it could mean the dividend amounts to a fairly large fraction of the share price."
[INST] Why do stock exchanges close at night? [/INST],"Stock exchanges have a long history that reflects how they evolved.  For much of its history, physical brokerages (not electronic exchanges) sold their clients the shares of a particular company for a price of their choice, a process called a ""stock subscription"".  The selling prices were negotiated, the shares traded without any central recordkeeping, and stock was not even transferable (except through the broker) until the late 19th century.  This arrangement could lead to brokers inflating prices through a variety of mechanisms, and it was ripe for corruption and manipulation.  This is why the term ""Wall Street Gangsters"" persists to this day.   The NYSE (and other exchanges like it) were set up to formalize this process.  You can sell shares by submitting an order for a particular price and number of shares to the NYSE.  If your order is matched immediately, the trade is executed.  If it is not matched immediately, the order is entered into the order book, and you will get notified if (and when) your order is matched.  This order book is the ""exchange"" aspect of the stock ""exchange"". Once your order is matched, the NYSE records it as a trade by date, time, buyer, seller, price, and number of shares and updates its records accordingly.  The NYSE does not hold the physical shares themselves, you would not get a physical certificate in the mail or anything like that.  When your order gets matched, the shares are credited to your account, and your broker gets the money.   So, what's the point of the NYSE?  Why use them instead of using our broker?  Well, an important part of modern stock exchanges is that they are required to be as fair and objective as possible, so the NYSE (and other exchanges like it) cannot know or deal in any sensitive financial information or use it in any way other than to guarantee that the trade is executed.  If the NYSE knew or could use this information, it would have a very strong incentive to exploit it to its advantage, and that would ruin the exchange.  Therefore, the exchanges are (and must be) legally bound to only accept order information that can be made public and to execute them according to the terms set by everyone on the exchange. When the financial crisis began in 2007-2008, one of the first steps taken by the government and financial institutions was to create electronic exchanges.  Before then, physical brokerages (like Goldman Sachs) were more prevalent, and you submitted orders to them via telephone, fax, or a messenger.  You could even submit orders in person.  The only reason to accept orders until then was because of the logistics of paperwork.  However, electronic orders could be processed much faster. In general, all that an exchange does is take your order information, process it, and match it against other orders.  All of this would be possible without a central physical location.  This is why there are now multiple electronic exchanges.  They are essentially virtual exchanges; they only have a central website and customer service number.  You could theoretically execute a trade without ever having had any direct contact with them. One disadvantage to electronic exchanges is that there are no physical records of orders to match against.  If another trader believes the exchange has been tampered with, one recourse is to check the physical evidence.  With electronic trading, that is no longer possible.  However, with the advancements in cryptography that have been made throughout the 20th century, a tampered system could be detected.  Additionally, the log files used in trading would be much more secure, and they could theoretically remain the same whether executed electronically or physically (even if physically executed, they still have to be entered electronically eventually).  With electronic exchanges, however, they can never be as secure as they could be with physical records. Now, all of the above is a description of how physical exchanges operate, which is how the first ones were created.  Exchanges (especially electronic ones) have since evolved.  Some exchanges are simply the order book of a particular exchange, and not directly connected with it.  Others do everything from order taking to matching to trading. Many of these exchanges (including electronic ones) allow you to submit order data on their website or electronically, but the stock exchanges (including electronic ones) themselves do not do anything to actually process those trades, but simply maintain the trade information for historical and reference purposes. One of the disadvantages with this is that the orders are not processed until someone else sells or buys your stock at the price you set (i.","The financial district would only be open for so many hours a day. With advances in technology there may well be a point where it is possible to offer continuous trading. However, it is my understanding (forgive me I am not from a background in finance) there are other considerations such as the legal framework under which the exchanges would like to exist. I think it is also a matter of risk. Given the exponential growth in the volume of transactions on the financial market continuous trading could lead to a number of problems.

[INST] What is the opposite of a sunk cost? A “sunk gain”? [/INST],"In investing, sunk costs are not really all that relevant. In terms of investments you can look at what a specific investment is, compare it to the rest of your portfolio, compare its price and projected earnings to what you expect of the rest of your portfolio, etc. and make a decision on which would be more profitable.  Sunk costs can also work out in your favor; for example:  You bought some shares in company X from a company that was in trouble, and you got the stock really  cheap because everybody else was selling off their shares. You held on to them after everybody else had given up and sold their shares, and they started to go back up in price.  So, now they're much higher than when you got them. But you're still holding on to them; would it be smart to sell them?   In that scenario it would be better to hold on to those shares and take the gains from them, in terms of the gains, than to sell them now when you could make more gains from them in the future.  If you can, do.","While there are others, I believe you are asking about ""sunken costs"" vs. ""opportunistic costs"". If so, then:  Opportunistic cost refers to the lost business from not taking the contract. You are more familiar with the sunk cost which is the money you have already invested, so you don't walk away when things are not looking good on the profit trail.  In a small business it is very common for an owner to consider the opportunity and the risk that they will regret their choice.  With sunk costs at all times.  At first the sunk costs may be nothing since the business did not make any sales. Once you have a few sales, you may need to rent or build a display area to show off your product - creating additional sunk costs."
[INST] What is a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) & how is it different from plain stock? [/INST],"A Master Limited Partnership or MLP is a special entity created to hold a common interest in the energy business. The MLP shares are divided into units, where each unit being similar to the common stock of the MLP, with the difference that unit is comprised of common stock of the MLP and interest in the real estate of the master limited partnership, thus making the dividends of the MLP partially tax exempt, and allowing the company to deduct in the income tax the percentage of the property that is considered real estate, rather than the entire company.  In addition, MLP shares tend to be more risky than stocks, considering that they are subjected to changes in commodities, changes in the income of the company due to tax deductions and also to variations in the prices of common stocks if this type of business is affected by certain factors. All these considerations are necessary to analyze this type of business for investors looking for stability and high dividends and profits. The MLPs have a complex structure, which is mainly responsible for tax deductions, and it is also very hard to evaluate due to the fact that this type of business changes tax obligations throughout the years.  The MLP structure is mostly a combination of common stock and the tax treatment of partnerships. A master limited partnership consists of two basic components: the partnership and the publicly registered partnership interests traded on a national securities exchange. The entity that creates the partnership is a general partner, which is responsible for the partnership's business activities and operations, while the other group that holds a direct or indirect interest in the partnership is the limited partner, who just invests money without having the same obligations that the general partner has. The MLP is a publicly traded, so it is important to differentiate it from the MBS which is a type of security or financial instrument, whose value is derived from the underlying asset and the income collected.","An MLP is a type of business. An MLP combines a pass through entity with a limited partnership. The pass-through entity is typically a C-Corporation or an LLC taxed as a corporation (S-Corp, Sub S, or L-LCO). If an individual partner in the MLP sells their ownership interest, he/she will owe capital gains tax on the difference between the selling price and purchase price, but will not be subject to self-employment tax. He/she will be subject to self-employment tax on annual distributions of profit.  (For simplicity, let's assume all the partners' ownership interest in the MLP was purchased at the same cost with the same basis.) If the MLP sells an asset that has appreciated in value, the individual partners will owe capital gains tax on their share of the gains. This tax will be in addition to the self-employment tax for the distribution of profit.  The MLP tax incentives are meant to encourage ownership of infrastructure (pipelines, storage tanks, oil wells, etc.), and it provides a tax advantage in certain situations. An individual partner can deduct their share of the losses of the MLP to the extent of their share of the basis against their salary income, but any loss greater than the partner's share of the MLP's at-risk capital will be carried forward to subsequent tax years.  An MLP is attractive to many investors. The tax advantages allow the MLP to pay less in dividends, while the partnership structure lowers their investment risk. This can provide an advantage to an MLP when competing for oil or gas reserves."
[INST] How come we can find stocks with a Price-to-Book ratio less than 1? [/INST],"Book value means ""this is the most liquid asset value of the stock"".  The stock may sell at a price lower than book value when the future earnings of the stock are not worth that book value.","I suspect the reason is to be sought in the financial press and in the actions of analysts and the company in question – the company’s PR people probably want their stocks to look attractive. Price to book value per share is the ratio of market value of a company’s assets to its net shareholder’s equity, or the company’s net worth. Companies generally don’t have negative equity to start with, but it does happen. This is a rare case in which a merger leaves stock market equity exceeding the value of the firm’s balance sheet equity; the former value gets subsumed into the current owners’ stakes in the new company.  If this isn’t what’s happening in this case, the explanation lies elsewhere."
[INST] Why should one only contribute up to the employer's match in a 401(k)? [/INST],"If by ""the match"" you mean 100% (i.e. the employer matches your entire contribution dollar for dollar), then yes you would want to contribute up to the match.    However, in case you mean a less-than-100% match, your situation changes a bit. If your company matches 50% of your contribution, you might want to invest more than the match, but your best move is also dependent on what they do with the ""other"" 50% of your contribution. Many companies will ""put you in the S&P 500"" or something similar, not actually matching your contribution (i.e. your contribution is a transfer to your own retirement account, and the company is investing 50% of those in something else).   If your contributions are going into a retirement account managed by your employer, you may not have much control over the 50%. You may want to call their HR department and ask about this. You should figure out exactly where your contributions are going.","You should also be aware that any gains made in your 401(k) can't be tax-free for another 15 years (age 57 for many, you might be older before you can consider withdrawing what will grow into millions.)  In the meantime, you are missing out on all the money you could be making in a regular account, and you pay a high price (taxes) for investing that money.  Unless you've got that $8,896 in investment that you can put into the 401(k), or that money will go into your 401(k) to reach the matching limit (and you are not already over the regular contribution limit), you should skip the 401(k) and put them into a regular, tax-free savings account (CD, money market, or ETF/index fund).  That will serve you much better in the long run. If you need help on the mechanics of how to invest and make yourself money from this money so you can make it grow faster than inflation, ask in another question."
[INST] Why do banks finance shared construction as mortgages instead of financing it directly and selling the apartments in a building? [/INST],"The banks in Australia are very wary about any type of investment property loans.  We have had the financial collapse in the US that saw the downfall for many banks and investment firms.  Now our banking has become extremely stringent on investment property loans. What is causing the problem is most loan officers are unwilling to have an investment property in their loan portfolio.  Meaning you cant find a loan officer willing take a chance on your construction loan.   If we have a banking officer that is willing to take a chance on what is an unlikely construction loan, their employer is asking ""Does this person have their mortgage license?""  Which means a licensed loan officer can only lend out residential property loans.  Meaning you will have a hard time getting a banking officer who has the correct license to make your construction loan. In short, the banks are unwilling to take investment property loans.","There are a few possible reasons: First is that construction loans are usually quite short term -- a year or less.  During the year, not much equity will have been created.  The bank must foreclose, then take over control of the property and manage it.  Then sell it, often at a loss.  This puts more risk on the loan office's balance sheet, a risk many banks are reluctant to take.  If the bank were to sell shared construction before the year is up, that would require foreclosure.  That would cause them the same problem.  So instead the bank chooses to wait until there is substantially less risk of foreclosure. Another problem of the bank is that the construction must be finished within a year.  This can be hard to do.  For instance, if you get most of the materials and labor, and then you get a loan denial because they said there wasn't enough equity accumulated, that's bad.  You have to get the materials and labor back.  It could be that they have to go back into the market for a cheaper deal, which will take more than a year. Again, you want to have 80% equity after paying for all the materials, labor etc.  (80%, usually the maximum the bank will loan on). So you start with the total cost, and then the bank will loan you 80% of it, and you pay 20% of the cost.  That means you'll need materials and labor worth 25%. So even if they got you a loan, there is no way you could pay for that 25%.  Not right away anyhow, but they expect you to do that.  It would be a waste of their time and resources to loan them money they couldn't pay back. So you just borrow money from them that covers costs and you buy from them.  That would put you way behind in payments, and when it finally went to them, it would likely already be in foreclosure.  This is an expensive practice for the bank, so it costs the borrower money in the end. A third problem is that it would be impractical for the bank to sell the apartments.  That would just create more trouble.  You'd have some apartments rented, and others not.  You'd have some apartments that are up to code, and others not.  You'd have some finished, and some not.  You'd only be able to sell one apartment after another as they finished everything.  That would also be a hassle for the bank to deal with managing all that.  There's a better way. These are just some possible problems I can think of, that may differ from the problems of your loan officer.  Every loan is a little bit different.  Some of these problems could apply to many loans though."
"[INST] Transfer $50k to another person's account (in California, USA) [/INST]","The short version of this answer: Transfer the money between a bank in which both can have their funds in.  (In both banks accounts).  Transfer 25K each into their respective accounts.  If you are in the US go to the nearest check cashing store, and transfer a check between the both of you for $50000.  It is important, if they cash the check - you have the money in the other account.  The check can have either your name or their name.  This should not take much longer than 10 minutes to achieve.  Just sign the back of the check and transfer the funds into their bank account. Alternatively you could have them come here to the bank and fill out the paperwork to cash the check.  (If it is a large enough check I suggest this method).  But if its for a small amount, you could have them open an account here and do the check cashing that way, just know that it will take longer and cost more paperwork. Either way, you should be able to get the funds transferred in about 3-5 business days.","You need to file a gift tax return.  You are allowed to claim a $13,000 exemption per person.

[INST] Why do put option prices go higher when the underlying stock tanks (drops)? [/INST],"Consider three scenarios as to how you could profit from a sudden drop in price: If you think the drop will be sustained and the price of the underlying stock will not recover for a while, you should take the first step and exercise whatever puts you hold. If you decide to take your profit selling the puts in the market, you can take your money and go home. If you think the sudden drop could be only a short blip in the price of the stock, rather than a turn in a long-term trend, you might want to hold and wait for the price to recover to where it was before the sudden drop.  However, if the drop is only a momentary fluctuation, there is no guarantee that the stock's price will suddenly snap back to where it was even immediately before the drop.  The probability of a sudden rise back up is highest if the price of the underlying stock is moving toward some significant value.  Consider that if you were to exercise the options now, then you'd be taking their intrinsic and time values and converting them into the value of the stock.   What you're seeing is the market giving you a greater chance that the drop will be sustained - and hence that the price of the stock will be lower in the future - by giving you a higher intrinsic value on the puts.   If you do take the first step and exercise as you believe the price will continue to go down, you might be disappointed, because you're locked in at your exercise price no matter what happens later on.    Consider a put option for $20 expiring next month, with the underlying stock trading at $21.  The intrinsic value is $1 and the time value is about $0.40 on your put. You exercise this and get 100 shares. Suddenly the price of the underlying stock goes to $15, and the puts start trading for over a dollar. You might think you've gotten a great deal; you just paid $10 for each share of the stock.  However, because you're locked into that price, consider the fact that if the stock went right back up to $21 immediately the put option would be worthless (assuming your options were American style).  So now if the price of the stock suddenly shoots up - for no reason other than the short lived volatility - you can't take advantage and get a quick profit; you're stuck holding the shares.   Also consider that the option traders don't know the market is likely to go back up, only you do, so they would probably have to be convinced that the market is about to go up before their options would be of any interest to you.  If they think like you do, and the price of the stock still trades at $15, then you could get stuck with your stock, because the puts might be worth a dollar or more, and you'd be spending more than a dollar to get each share of the stock and have no interest in buying it because you believe the stock is heading lower.","The risk of an investor exercising the put option is at an all time low following a drop in the stock price. That lowers the value of the put option and increases the price. If the stock price stays low, the price of the put option will stay high because the probability of exercise is likely to stay high. Suppose the option is worth $0.50 when ABC goes from $20 to $19 a share. Its price would probably decrease if ABC went even lower, in order to discourage investors from exercising the option while the price is at a long term low in the near future.  If ABC goes back up, the probability of exercise decreases as the price increases, the riskier it seems to exercise early, and the cheaper the put option. This is one reason why companies like Google use the put option as a tactic to keep employees from selling too soon after an IPO, and why companies buy back their own shares in order to increase the price of the share in the market. It's also why insiders or those at the company may be tempted to take out put options. Another way of looking at the reason is that a put option provides a hedge as the price of the stock goes down. This hedge may be valuable to those who have already bought shares in the company. The drop in puts when the stock rises is an effect of the increase in probability of exercise. Suppose the put is $0.50 when ABC is at $20, a drop to $19 makes it more likely it will approach or stay below the strike price at later dates. The put option holder may feel he's more likely to exercise, making the put option worth more.  These options aren't free.  When you or someone else exercises the put, the company pays for the shares of ABC that are returned or purchased on your behalf.  The company makes less profit if a high share price forces them to buy a large amount of shares, and loses more money if the stock's price does not rebound. This is sometimes the opposite of a drop in the share price."
[INST] I am the sole owner of an LLC. Does it make a difference if I file as an S-Corp or a sole-member LLC? [/INST],"As JoeTaxpayer's answer indicates, if you are the sole owner of a business there is little gain in forming a corporation in the first place to obtain the liability protection that makes sense in a more typical scenario. On the second question, the big difference between filing as an S-Corp v. a sole member LLC is how the distributions are treated. S-Corp distributions, especially for salaries to the owners, have some tricky IRS rules and guidelines to keep straight. If you choose this entity type, I'd highly recommend getting an accountant to help your with the legal and financial aspects. LLCs are simpler all around as they're more flexible and easier to understand in this regard, and also allow more flexibility. When you elect to pay taxes as an LLC (instead of a corporation), the earnings are simply divided based on the percentage of ownership (meaning that more ownership = more profit). You determine the ownership proportions based how much you've invested or however you otherwise come to an agreement. You have a little more control over your tax filing and the way the business is organized in an LLC, so the paperwork and reporting is more flexible. As such, the LLC has more flexible structures, a different default structure, and the rules regarding entity types varies a bit. So, it can definitely benefit you to select an LLC in this case, but you need to know how those structures are defined before you make your final decision. In the situation you've described in your question, which you can always structure differently if you need, the rules for an LLC are likely more beneficial. A good start would be taking a look at the differences between sole proprietorships, LLCs, and corporations to gain a little knowledge of the concepts. Also, there are specific differences and guidelines for forming an LLC in your state - so be sure to get some legal information there as well before taking that step.","The main issues would be your liability if a creditor or plaintiff got a judgment which exceeded your insurance or your own personal assets. A creditor would be looking to go after the entity, not its controlling members. To protect your personal assets you want liability protection from your corporation which would normally be accomplished via a General Corporation. You need to have it set up so that you can file the Articles of Organization to your state and get the IRS EIN so you are operating correctly. You could save the taxes and set up an S Corporations which allows some of the income to flow to a personal return where you can then offset against ordinary income. Or you could set up a C Corporation which pays its own taxes so some of the income is still tax free, but you end up getting a business income tax return as well as a personal income tax return."
[INST] How can I use hedging strategies to manage my wealth? [/INST],"Hedging is a risk management strategy used by individuals and businesses to minimize potential losses from an undesirable outcome. It is typically used in conjunction with a long position, such as a stock, to reduce the impact of price drops. Hedging can also be used to reduce the impact of currency swings or interest rate changes.

Individuals may use hedging strategies by investing in financial instruments such as futures or derivatives, which are designed to help protect the value of an investment from price fluctuations. These markets allow individuals to sell or buy contracts at a specific price and set time, such that the holder of the contract gains if the value of the underlying asset increases above the strike price, but also takes a loss if there is a decline in value.

Companies may also use hedging strategies to manage their risk. By investing in options or other derivatives, they can ensure that the value of their investment does not drop, thus reducing their future losses. Additionally, businesses might invest in commodity-related futures to manage the risk associated with commodity markets. For example, companies with heavy exposure to oil price swings can buy futures in order to protect against the downside risks associated with a drop in prices.","Hedging strategies are used by investors to offset losses by reducing or eliminating risk. Hedging strategies do not aim to increase profit, but rather to decrease losses that would be incurred through certain positions in the market. Using a hedge, an investor's portfolio will retain the same exposure and overall value, but reduce the potential short-term fluctuation. These strategies are used by individuals and organizations when in the process of investing in securities or commodities. One example of a hedging strategy is selling the securities they have, or short selling, which is the opposite of a buy order. If an investor is invested in many different commodities, they can use shorting of the commodities. There is also put and call options. If an investor buys put options, they gain in value should the underlying commodities move below the purchase price. If instead they opt for call options, they gain in value should the commodity move above.  Options in and of themselves are risky. As is the case with many strategies, there is a level of risk in the implementation of this strategy.  Other types of hedging strategies include buying and holding the securities, or buying options against those securities. These strategies are very complex, and should only be used by those who understand them thoroughly."
[INST] Is there a government-mandated resource that lists the shareholders of a public company? [/INST],"Some information, as to at least part of your question here. You can search the SEC's EDGAR system for a 13D and 13G filing (and a few others that may apply).  However, this is not a comprehensive list, only a subset. There is also an S-1, but the S1 is very rare. In addition, an S-3 can be filed, but the S-3 is a secondary offering, and often not the initial issue. (It also has other reporting requirements.) A filing statement is also often included, to indicate that such a filing was omitted before the IPO.  The key is also looking at the ""period ending.""   I've pulled this filing list from the SEC's website (which is where the SEC collects and disseminates this info about publicly traded companies). http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html If you enter your ticker symbol, it'll search for that and pull up all of the securities that that symbol represents.   If there are none returned, you may need to check your symbols, maybe something about the space bar, or the capitalization.  The ticker symbols are NOT case sensitive, and this also searches for the various ""tics"" that are often used by brokers, for example ""EZ-A"" is a ticker for Amazon.Com. http://www.sec.gov/Divisions/investorinfo/marketstructure/stockticker.pdf Other companies use a space, instead of a hyphen, though "" "" also works in a search.  14a is often used for a definitive proxy statement. A 14C is a solicitation only, and requires a 14D being filed in order to confirm a vote. (Thus there is also an 14D/A filling required as a follow up.)  These may also appear in the ""amendments"" section, if the first filing did not contain everything that was required or needed to be added for the specific action. If you click on each item, it'll bring you to a detail page about the filing.  There are separate filing systems for 8K, 10K, etc, that are not part of EDGAR (though some, like Forms 8K, 10Q, 10-K are also part of the system) However, there are more than 100 filing systems that all use the EDGAR system. This is only a small portion of items that are part of a 13D. However, this should give you enough to work with at least, and you can find the rest of the specific information you need if you wish to take this further.","Yes, there is. Many countries have public repositories that, for a nominal fee, you can look up how many shares of a company were sold on a particular day to specific buyers.

[INST] Renters Liability in Case of Liability Claims for Property Damage or Fire [/INST],"Doesn't matter what the insurance coverage is, you should always be covered.  If your landlord has insurance, then the landlord's insurance should pay out unless you specifically get into a bad situation.  If your landlord does not have insurance, then you should be compensated by the company that you have insurance through.  If you have a fire in your apartment and it spreads to the other units, you can easily sue the other tenants that caused the damage and the landlord for damages.  I am a landlord as well but i am also underinsured so hopefully none of my tenants have to pay any more than what they have contracted to pay me to rent the property. I hope this helps.","Homeowners insurance covers the homeowner for liability up to the declared limits of their policy.  You can sue your landlord for damages and collect.  However, your landlord probably only has a couple million in a liability insurance policy, just like you only have a few million dollars in personal assets.  Most liability coverage on homes is ""personal injury.""  This is an injury to a person, usually intentional.  Some examples:   The landlord doesn't really have insurance for fire, water, or casualty damage to the rental property if it is covered under the renter's policy.  However, some landlords do have a renters protection policy if the renter will be charged for damage.  This coverage is in case the renter sues because the renter thinks the landlord isn't properly maintaining the rental property, or that the landlord improperly denied a request to make repairs to the rental property.  The landlord's liability insurer will pay those legal fees, and the renters protection policy pays the renters legal fees.  These fees can be very expensive and may equal or exceed the coverage limits of the renter's liability policy. As for what a judge would do, that depends on whether your damages exceed $25,000.  If it does, then you can sue the landlord for negligence if the landlord was derelict in their duties.  They also must have the money to pay for the damages.  As such, you may want a lawyer anyway to take photos and document your claims.  At the same time file a lawsuit against the landlord."
[INST] How do you measure the value of gold? [/INST],"You can read more about it here: Measuring Gold by Investopedia Gold is a good choice of money because it is liquid, portable, durable, and it never wears out. Gold has a long history as the currency of economies and was the currency by which nations traded because it was universally accepted and easy to trade because it wasn't heavy and took a lot of space.","According to my reading, gold is treated as a commodity.  That is, the value of gold is the price that someone will pay for it now.  That is, gold is ""worth"" whatever people have agreed to exchange for it.   However, a large fraction of gold is used in non-consumption items.  Therefore, the value of an ounce of gold is not always the same number."
[INST] Can a wealthy investor invest in or make a deal with a company before it goes public / IPO? [/INST],"You don't really need to get your company's pre-IPO shares if you have it ""as private company"". You just need to look for the best deal. I mean you can invest in other companies or invest in shares of IPO companies that can have even higher values that your own company.  The market of non-listed stock is smaller. The market of non-IPO company is smaller. Also you are going to need a professional help to value your private company and for the negotiations. So if you really think your company will raise a lot of money after IPO, then I'l highly suggest you to sell it to a bigger and successful company, who can invest more on your product / service development, and get a big money in your pocket.  If you want to do so, then you'll need to find companies who can afford to buy your company, and invest a lot in it. Or you can try and make a partnership, and give them the whole control of it. But this one is not very common for startups, for the fact the owners tend to have problems to give up control. But you have to realize that your company is valuable to you precisely because someone can give you the best deal for it. Or you can get a professional help to buy into other companies. But this is very risky, a lot of people who get out of their job to invest in other companies ended up with nothing or a lot less. But it can be the case that it will increase a lot. It is the same principle. If you don't have a stock company, then you need to invest in more than one stock company as you need money to survive and to have a good rate of return. In other words, you cannot rely only on ONE stock that will give you a very high growth over 20 years to allow to retire. If you have a good stock company, and you have been given high raises, and you are not yet 50. Then it is worth it to look for the best deal.","There is no such thing as a private investment that is a copy of a future publicly traded investment.  At the same time, the fact that a company is publicly traded is not necessarily indicative of how the investment performs.  For example, Facebook was a terrible investment after it was traded publicly.  It took nearly a year to start going up, and even longer to make back the initial investment.  A private investment in Facebook, or in another company that performs the same way as Facebook, could fail altogether before it could go public. Even among publicly traded investments, two of the best ""growth"" stocks of all time (Apple and NVIDIA) barely traded for ten dollars per share when they first started trading publicly. If you were to invest in Facebook at ten times the current price, you would find its valuation in less than a week to be a terrible investment."
[INST] Can rent be added to your salary when applying for a mortgage? [/INST],"Generally, if you could have lived without the rent, you could have been saving to buy the house you now want to live in with that money.  Yes, it is possible to add it into the equation, but it shouldn't be taken as a ""for sure"" because it means there is one more factor that does not belong in the equation.  For every dollar of rent that is deducted, you should save at least a dollar.","Yes, in the general sense you can include rent as income when applying for a mortgage.  However, how this income is counted should be discussed with your mortgage broker / banker in detail.  Some types of income are not counted if they will continue into the future.  For example, if you inherit every 10 months a certain amount of money, that income may be excluded as they could dry up at any time. For rent, as long as you have a renewed or renewable tenancy, the bank will generally assume you will always continue to receive the income.  As such, the bank does not usually consider rent as non-guaranteed income.  However, if you are a paying a fixed and predetermined rent for the duration of your tenancy and the rent paid is less than your estimated mortgage payments, the income is sometimes not counted, this also applies in some circumstances when you're not paying rent to someone else (eg if you were living with your parents). In these cases, you should ensure that the rental property is in your name, as banks may not consider these rental payments as actual rental payments to you, but rather just payments to someone else. In these cases, the bank will consider your property tax, municipal property tax and repair / maintenance costs as a part of your regular housing costs and therefore reduce their estimate of the property value.  If you are not sure, your bank may require you to get an independent appraisal done before approving the mortgage at the higher ratio.  If you are unable to produce the appraisal and your monthly income is low enough to support the down payment, the bank may approve you for the higher ratio mortgage because your debt servicing expenses will be low enough.  Even if you do provide an appraisal and are approved, you might require a more flexible structure for your mortgage in order for the bank to lend to you. The more flexible structures may have higher interest rates, prepayment restrictions or other penalties.  If you do this, the bank will want to see this appraisal and have this included with the other documents you provided."
[INST] Investment for beginners in the United Kingdom [/INST],"I have done well in my 26 years of investing.  When I started I was reading one book a day and studying, learning, listening and reading more.  I have written a little on how I have done this HERE, but I will offer some simple guidelines and the reasons why it makes sense to follow them. The guidelines are as follows:  1)   Start by saving enough for a down payment on a home at least one year before you want to buy.  That means by saving about 18,000 pounds a year, you can buy a nice place with about 75,000 pounds (a 50% deposit).  This is the best loan on the market and you will save many dollars in interest by having a big down payment.  This is also going to save you 3% to 5% in closing costs or about 450 pounds for 150,000 pound mortgage. As you build equity, refinance to lower the interest rate or go to 15 year mortgage, or both.  In 7 to 10 years you will be out of the mortgage and have a paid for house.  Then you can save for a bigger house or for a second home overseas if you like. Do not do this if you want to start a family.  It is hard to take care of young children and move them to a new country.  2)  Put another 20 to 25 percent of your income aside into a 401k for retirement and get the employer match.  After that, continue to save for retirement out of this income but don't get too carried away, you have a mortgage to pay.  If you are a high earner, put more away or consider getting a 403b (some occupations have this benefit instead). It will be very hard to do this unless you are on a set budget, so write one and follow it.  Put the 401k into a balanced fund with 40% stocks, 60% bonds... the exact amount is not so relevant... a little more or less is fine.  It will make a bit of difference in your returns.  Do put the Roth IRA option in mind.  It makes excellent sense especially in the United States.  If you are a high earner, put the money into a separate savings account in another country that will earn decent interest, like say 10%, which beats what a savings account is likely to pay here.  You might even use that money for investments in another country.  The United States is no a good investment option anymore.  The dollar is only going down in value.  3)  Take and invest your tax return for the year.  Even though you have saved already it will grow faster than normal because of the 8% you are earning on the money in a savings account.  Keep this amount in cash.  Every now and then move some of the cash into a long term investment, preferably one that allows withdrawals before age 59 1/2.  4) When your emergency fund is where you want it, start investing any more income from bonuses or pay raises in stocks and mutual funds of companies you have researched and like.  Then increase the amount every year.  This can be in one company or multiple companies.  Do this at least 3 to 5 years before you want to retire.  You can put $5,000 in a stock every 6 months plus another $625 in a company that allows stock purchase plans. If you don't want to invest in stocks, then trade commodities, currencies or other options like gold or silver.  This increases the level of risk and makes returns much more difficult to come by.  Do not invest in them at the same time.  For instance if you have the cash and buy stock you can also buy currency and gold in addition because your cash will be tied up.  When you have the money back and want to put it into stock, then sell the gold or currency.  Do this at least a month before the stock transaction.  The money that you will get back on the other transactions should be just enough to buy the stock that you want.  Gold is going to go up as long as people are buying it, but it could be much higher than it is today.  The dollar is going to get lower and lower, so buy currencies of countries that are doing well, like Canada, Switzerland and Australia. The more money you have to invest, the higher the level of risk, unless you use a 401k style arrangement and then you can't touch your money until you","It's important that you take full responsibility for your own financial security.  This responsibility for your finances should extend beyond retirement investment, but let's start with some very basic advice: You should seek to reduce your debt and then build an emergency fund. Both before and after investing in your retirement.  If we can get you out of debt, then let's look at ways we could use your money to do things that you're confident with, and not simply speculate on how things may or may not pan out over 30 to 40 years.  If you can take investment advice and make your money work for you then this is the one other thing I'd encourage you to do:  Dollar cost average. Invest at regular intervals.  You may find it convenient to make a deposit to your pension each month for now, and make further regular deposits once you start receiving your paycheck."
[INST] I cosigned for a friend who is not paying the payment [/INST],"I think the best way is to ask them how much they are paying monthly and how much of it is the principal.  Offer to pay a portion of the principal as long as they commit to paying the interest.  For example if it has a $360/month payment, offer to pay the $216 in principal.  That cuts the payments in half over a few years, so they could get on some other plan or just have a more reasonable payment.  (You should also be aware of how this may change their debt to income ratio) And be ready to be very firm about a deadline.  And be ready to walk away if they will not agree to any sort of plan.  If they are willing, then do what you can afford and you should be fine.  Just make sure you don't pay for an accident that was not your fault.","You are completely uninformed.  You can be held to default on a liabilities under any or all provisions. The only reason lenders will loan is because another person cosigns and you are only considered the primary applicant. If you agree to it - so be it, you still will be subject to what ever default provisions are in the agreement.  And this is by law and not because the lender said so. You need to know the terms of the agreement you agree to and if they were put down in writing, then you need to verify that the paperwork is accurate for the transaction.   The lender will do what ever they have to to get their money back.  This can often include turning debt collectors on you and putting a lien on your personal property if you do not make the payments.  And there could be a huge amount of interest stacking up even while you are paying the loan down.  You should consider it a red flag if they do not ask for a cosigner to even open the account.   You are not completely unbiased, you do not have any facts to be unbiased.  Just because the person does not pay does not mean that you can stop paying.  You are considered the primary and are subject to the full debt.  If he continues to refuse to pay after you start paying, you are in for a world of trouble as you are the person the lender will turn to for making payments. In the event you do pay it off, your friend has not paid a penny, that is a very bad situation to be in. Lenders will only look and what you have as your income, if you cosign, they will ignore what you are worth. If you agree to cosign, in all likelihood, you friend will not pay.  You do not have the power of 2, 2 of you against 3 is usually not enough to outnumber the creditor.  I would suggest that you decline the loan and make your friend find another lender.   Be very careful of this situation, in most cases the friend never pays and the lender comes after you to recover the amount of the loan that is being paid off.  You will never get them off of your record because there was an agreement that said you would be liable for the balance if it was not paid.  This is not something that you would ever want in your record.  This can be as big a deal as a felony on your record."
[INST] Put idle savings to use while keeping them liquid [/INST],"You also have to examine who is making you money on these investments: you, somebody else, or the bank. If you have some friends to whom you would like to loan some money to, you could consider making your cash available to loan.  If your friend pays you back, you've made money.  If they don't pay you back, well, that sucks for you.  If you have a friend whom you have loaned money to before without any issues, this could be a good way to make money without running your own business.","I'll add to what others said in this area: Investing in stocks or funds should not be viewed as an expense or tax for your money; it should be viewed as a way to multiply your money. The only real ""tax"" of trading is the time it takes to do the work and pay the fees, and even then this is far less tax than the potential gains of making a good investment. In other words, when an investment pays off, you gain more value -- whether you buy a stock or fund for 10 Euros, or 10 Million, you gain if the price goes up or down. So, put your money in a savings account if you are short-term or unskilled at the stock market. Do your homework though: A small, diversified portfolio of stocks is less risky, and likely to give you better returns than a bigger portfolio of stocks/bonds. It may also increase your chances at a gain by helping you get into the habit of saving and investing. The point of investing is to gain financial advantage by building value. The real problem with trading is that it's not a sure-fire win: stocks can increase and decrease in value, and can be risky, or it can just be that you chose poorly. Trading is for folks who are comfortable with losing value -- like gamblers; it's a game and there are rules and odds. Investing in companies is for people who want to make money and don't want to take as much risk as gambling (e.g. the majority of the population). You increase your chance of success, and the value of your money, by educating yourself: This includes reading financial documents, and understanding the markets you plan on investing in."
[INST] Are prepayment penalties for mortgages normal? [/INST],"There used to be a time when you'd want to pay your mortgage off early, because it meant that you were cutting your interest costs and thus increasing your overall wealth.  A prepayment penalty prevents you from doing this, but not many people do it anymore unless they have to close on a house quickly or are offered a very attractive mortgage rate. There is at least one case in which you may consider it: if you are using your down payment to buy a less expensive home and are going to apply the proceeds from the sale of the old house as additional principal on your new mortgage. In this situation, any prepayment penalties that you incur can be seen as essentially interest on the down payment. This of course requires that the house sell for enough money to clear the down payment as well as cover the prepayment penalty.","In order to cover himself in case of loan default, a lender will usually charge a fee for prepaying the loan.  This is because prepayment could mean they don't make as much interest as they intended to.  But he is not supposed to make the fee unreasonable.  If the penalty is high, there are rules in place that the bank has to justify the penalty, usually in ways the mortgagee does not find favorable.  A bank can make their own rules on the mortgage, but they may be overruled by state or federal law regarding the interest rate or penalties they are allowed to attach. Here's a quick read from one state:  https://www.attomdata.com/news/foreclosure-news-headlines/prepayment-penalties-homeowner The prepayment penalty is different than a prepayment that you are trying to make in order to avoid bankruptcy and the foreclosure.  If you are trying to save your home to avoid bankruptcy, ask about that.  There are usually ways your home could be saved if it is owned by only one spouse, the other spouse is in debt, and you have lived in it for at least two years.  Otherwise you can avoid it by paying the original price, which includes penalties.  Be sure to read the terms of any mortgage documents that you may sign."
"[INST] After consulting HR Block, are you actually obligated to file your taxes with them, if they've found ways to save you money? [/INST]","To my experience, yes. However your mileage may vary, of course. If your bill was paid, then HR Block is obligated to handle it. In one of my experiences they took longer than they expected and my state fined me for not filing my taxes on time (the bill being payed, in this example, isn't tax filing per se but the equivalent procedure in Europe).","First, yes, you can go to a different professional for a second opinion.  You need to be careful that you have everything you need when going through a second one, though.  You don't want to have to pay for the same things twice. If the tax advisor says ""We can save you X in the form of A, B, C, and D, do you want those credits?"" you can say no and you'll still get your refund.  If you get to the point where they've done everything and they say, it's time to sign.  That point is where you need to ask, ""What exactly did you do to reduce my tax liability?"" or similar and you need to make sure you're signing for the refund you've earned and it's not just a blank check. If you say ""no, you didn't find me all the credits you could,"" the advisor can't very well say ""but the software doesn't know how to do this particular one.""  That's like them telling you you should get another 300lbs of meat from the butcher and you go back to the place and there's no meat, your choice of meat is the one they're claiming you're missing. A really good advisor can sit down with the tax software and walk you through how they get the numbers they get."
[INST] What effect would a company delisting from the LSE to move to china have on shareholders? [/INST],"There is no ""shareholder vote"" on a delisting, and the company is not obliged to offer to buy/transfer investors' shares to the new owners or to any third party. Depends on the contract, but the owners of a VC fund do have a vote that gives them some control over what happens.","There would be the cost of the delisting and re-listing in China for investors to get back the returns they wanted. Also, in some cases, the Chinese laws limit foreign investors to get back their shares. It's possible the re-listing wouldn't be 1/1 with the LSE, and there would be some loss of value. Another cost to shareholders is the potential loss in liquidity that may come with moving to the Chinese market. Also, I'm not sure there is a Chinese equivalent of a GBP or USD, so you might have some fluctuations in the currency and have a cost to have to trade from a GBP to the Chinese currency. It is also possible that having shares in an entity with a Chinese exchange would give that entity exposure to political risks in Chinese government."
[INST] Does Technical Analysis work or is it just a pointless attempt to “time the market”? [/INST],"The market is very, very inefficient. While many would argue that technical analysis may be no better than the old ""Shot in the Dark"" method of stock buying, others note that this kind of analysis is just used to filter stocks to either buy if they hit their entry price in order to reduce risk and increase overall efficiency. Many investment professionals also use it for risk management: setting stop-loss/stop-buy points to ensure that the strategy remains profitable when a stock has reached a certain percentage beyond the initial entry price/stop-sell price and vice versa. So while technical analysis is not an accurate or reliable enough method for stock investment in itself, it can be used by professionals as a compliment to other methods of investing.","I will address only this part of your question: A lot of technical stock analysts claim to be able to tell that the stock will go 'up', 'down' or 'hold' after a certain trigger has been crossed. Why is this not true? There is nothing wrong with this. The problem is how the tool is applied. If you look at the chart, you will see that certain price patterns (such as the head and shoulder) tend to produce particular behavior in the price action. This action can be used to estimate or forecast what potential returns such a action can yield - at the individual security-level. However, at the index-level (S&P500, FTSE100, CAC40) where many technical analysis traders base their trades, it can be difficult to find a single chart pattern to represent the entire market. Such a approach is inappropriate as it does not take into account all the different companies operating in the basket. Therefore, the above method can be applied - but it is inappropriate for index trading. In the end, technical analysis is a method to apply an efficient or fundamental approach to trading. It does not claim that it can accurately forecast or estimate the movements all the time. In fact, the method is less efficient as it is more dependent on other factors (traders' sentiment, technical levels' levels etc.). The efficiency relies on the trader being able to adapt and interpret the information presented to him / her and use the analysis in the most appropriate manner for the instruments they trade."
[INST] How should I record invoices in foreign currency in GNUCash? [/INST],"If you're referring to how you should set up GnuCash, it looks like you don't need to do anything new to the accounts themselves, you only need to set the foreign currency to be used in the Payment details for invoices in the Receive Payment dialog. To do this, open the invoice, right click on the invoice transaction, select Receive payment, and set the currency in the Payment details section.","It's a common issue. Every business will deal with invoices and expenses in multiple currencies. If you want to properly keep a real time and accounting of your business, you have to have the currency rate as a separate account. I'll create a fictitious example to show you what I mean : Let's say you have an American client who owes you 100€. Let's also assume that you sold your product for the €1. You would record 100€ in Asset: Client, 100€ in Liability: Invoice Receivable, then you record a journal to the Asset: Client Revenue, at an expense of 0. You record another journal to a gain account, at a profit of 1 and the liability of 10€ to the Expense: Foreign Exchange Change account, when you receive the invoice payment of €99.99. With this, as long as you have an asset account for each Client or Supplier, and a gain account for each currency, your double accounting is accurate and you can see it in real time. When there is a need for a gain or loss at the end of the year, all you need to do is to find your net profit/loss account for each currency and put your gain/loss accounts into it, or you create a journal at the end of the year that goes to the current, and creates a gain/loss account for the net gain/loss of each foreign currency. This can be daunting at the beginning, but it will save you a lot of headaches when you actually need to look at your real time financial information.  Good luck!"
[INST] Is being a landlord a good idea? Is there a lot of risk? [/INST],"From a legal side, I can say this depends on your state's laws on how much deposit is required for a given security deposit, and what can/can't be taken out of it if an issue arises later. What can you get back? The amount you can recover when you want to evict a tenant will vary from region to region, and state to state, so you might have to hire a lawyer to get past specifics at your state level. (if you're in the US for example, it really does vary, but there are a number of states that currently have 'rent-to-own' laws that are very much in your favor if you're the landlord; they basically say  that 'if it moves, it's the landlord's property and if it doesn't move, it's the tenant's property'. There are no states in the US with favorable laws to tenants to my knowledge, but in California, there are several cities that have laws that are far in Tenant's defense, but the State itself is pretty favorable to the Landlord's defense). You might also want to consider getting a separate Insurance policy, and if you don't have one, a Home Owner's policy. There is 'landlord' insurance to cover things; but you might consider the policy doesn't do so as much if you've got a property, tenant(s) and a mortgage; in case of catastrophic losses, your landlord would generally be expected to cover all costs above what the 'Home owner' or 'Renter' policy would cover as an option. If you're in an area with high insurance rates, you might consider a small separate policy that might help you with covering the mortgage. You should also check with how state and local laws affect rental property tax. In some places, you can get a number of deductions on taxes for owning rental property, while others you would be charged taxes for maintaining 'rental property'.  If you do decide to go down this route, I'd recommend that you research the details of laws where you live, find out what costs you really think you'll be getting back when you have to evict a tenant (or if you've decided to go all-out and rent this property to friends, I'd suggest an added legal agreement of some sort - make sure they pay you in full, or you'll have to turn them into debtors as friends, not that there's anything wrong with that..) Also see if your mortgage allows you to pay any portion of your mortgage against rent, or if you need to wait for rent to get paid in full before you can start paying back your mortgage (I'd also ask the lender if they can deduct the cost of mortgage insurance or PMI from that, so you can save some money there). You should also make sure that you're aware of the property inspections in your area (do I have to take photos or a video of the property, do I have to take readings of temperature and humidity etc). I'd also check for any local laws that can affect you; for example: if it's a small town, it might be illegal to rent to someone else, if you're trying to sell and rent to someone else, you'll have to wait a certain amount of time before you can rent out property, and you have to declare you're renting it out as an 'Investment property'. You'll also want to consider things like: are the tenants responsible for their own repairs? In some areas, the landlord has to maintain and/or make any repairs, and any costs must be applied to the tenant; but in other areas, you might make the tenant do their own repairs and charge them for their time and materials, provided you don't ask for more than a reasonable amount to charge them. In the US, the current standard for what can and cannot be held in a security deposit is generally covered in your state laws and Federal laws, but you'll still want to ensure you check the local codes of conduct: generally to protect tenants, many areas do not permit 'retaliatory' measures for a tenant against a landlord, so you're generally stuck with the rules unless you want to fight a tenant in court for a 'landlord evict'. In addition, if you have a tenant who refuses to pay rent, the rules may allow you to evict them, but it might require you to pay for the entire month or years of rent if the renter has already paid. The current legal system is complex; the laws of our modern system are far ahead of what the old world did. If you look back a while","I think you know the answer already.  Investing in property is risky.  If you can't handle risk, I suggest you get out now.  You could get into property without being in any sort of debt if you were to pay cash - but that means you would have to save for a while for a down payment if you were to take that route."
[INST] Should I consider my investment in a total stock market fund “diverse”? [/INST],"The ""diversification"" of any investment portfolio is always in the realm of probabilities, not certitudes. If you have a diverse portfolio that includes bonds or other investments that are not highly correlated with the stock market, you will be less risky. This is because a crisis such as the crisis that began in 2008 might not affect the investment that is not highly correlated with the stock market as adversely as it would affect the stock market. However, at the same time, if one of your non-stock investments is poorly thought out or is itself not highly diversified, it may also decline at the same time as the stock market; or if you diversify too much, you may end up not giving the stock market a chance to recover as when it is on its way up again the rest of your investments may end up going down. I think you should be investing in mutual funds instead of ETFs if you buy on a regular schedule and invest a fixed amount. The management fees of ETFs are just too high and they are more suitable to large purchases or trades where you get them at the NAV rather than through a market maker. You may also want to look into a company such as Fidelity (or maybe Charles Schwab or Vanguard) and try to balance your investments among mutual funds they have available. Don't just go for the lowest expense ratios, since you may find your choices are not very good. Instead look for mutual funds with a good record of beating the overall market without too much out-performance in bad periods. Fidelity has, for example, a number of mutual funds that might fit what you want, I find Vanguard too ""investor friendly"" so I tend to shy away from them; I find that their investments are in fact less varied and more likely to underperform the market when it goes down. The most important fact to understand what is that whatever happens, your wealth can still be more than adequate; thus, it doesn't matter if the stock market goes down but rather whether your wealth is more than what you need; how much risk you can be exposed to is limited by what you need later on, not by what your overall situation is at any point in time.","1) Investment funds must by law carry out periodic valuations of the value of their assets. They are then required to publish the results of the valuation as well as any variance between the previous valuations. 2) This can also be an element of their marketing as it is part of their sales pitch to potential investors. 3) These valuations occur independently of the manager. I.e. even if the manager is asleep they cannot stop the valuation being performed. 4) For this reason a single manager is unlikely, in and of itself, to bring a fund's assets into bankruptcy. The valuation process is designed to prevent this from happening. So, yes. You should consider your investment in a total stock market fund as diverse. It is designed specifically to be diverse and it will (in large measure) remain so."
[INST] How do wire transfers get settled? [/INST],"At the most basic level, a wire transfer is a message that you as the originator (with your bank) are going to send X amount of money to Y recipient, to be paid at a specific bank on a specific day.  The bank that received the wire then puts X amount in the account of the recipient at the bank they specified. To actually settle the wire transfer payment, funds from the sending bank will be wired to the receiving bank on the day payment is to be made. If it is an international wire transfer, then it is pretty much the same thing, but they just use the SWIFT network to do inter-reconciliation of payment instructions and processing. The SWIFT network allows for banks to get rid of the paper-based transmittal messages used in the past (which was the way we ended up with all the banks doing in-flight airplanes full of cash to pay for large amounts of money). Also, SWIFT has a lot of back-office support to make it easier for banks to pay the recipient.","A wire transfer would be similar to (but not the same as) a cashier's check. With a cashier's check the payer deposits US dollars into the bank, then the bank creates a ""check"" out of the money in the account. For the wire transfer, the bank sends something similar to ""Ach"" to the receiving banks account/account number then the receiving bank credits your account with the USD's in their foreign (i.e. not US) account."
[INST] What's the least risky investment for people in Europe? [/INST],"You can start doing this right now, right by your own house. Do you have any investments, shares, stocks, funds? Are you paying too much rent? Are you paying too much for running a car? You need to start an emergency savings, as you should not really do this in any other way and in emergency it will keep you going until you can settle your debts elsewhere. So in conclusion you can save 20%. You can find lots of financial advise on internet but before you start investing it would be nice if you could get to know something about personal finance and investing. It will help you to make a more educated choice what is the best fit for where you are now and where do you want to be in the long run. You may find it difficult to find that type of adviser. I would recommend to start checking out the following links I recommend, if you want to learn more about personal finance and investing, before you actually jump in the mud and risk your money somewhere else, until you are completely sure what are you doing and what do you really want to achieve.","There are lots of options, but this question is hard to answer.  The least risky depends on the investor. I am going to give an easy option for you first. Second will be for someone more adventurous and who can afford to lose a bit.  Option 1: Put every penny possible in an emergency fund of bank accounts.  Aim to have at least six months of emergency funds. Option 2: A bit riskier is to put money into long bond ETFs or bond equity ETFs.  For example an emerging equity and bond ETF will include bond securities plus equity in emerging markets.  You want to choose ETFs that are low cost but with long track records.  The reason for this riskier option is that most of this will go into countries that have a high probability of paying dividends and interest in the Euro currency.  In addition, the equity portion will mean that you are more invested in growing companies.  So, you are not going to have much risk here, as the interest plus company growth should pay for the cost of the dividend, even while currency moves or political events occur.  This option means you are doing more investing.  So there is more risk, but you are not going directly into a risky investment.  I would consider some of this money to buy some small caps in emerging markets, as their upside potential is greater, and you want some of this upside.  You would probably want to divide your funds so that no one country or company has too much of your money. So, you need to decide if you want to invest as is and grow 10% over 30 years or invest and invest in the best way for you.  You do not want to guess based on some advice.  You need to decide what your risk aversion is.  Once you do that you can make a decision."
[INST] When would one actually want to use a market order instead of a limit order? [/INST],"There are many reasons why a trader might not want to use a limit order or a stop loss order.  One major reason is that the stock price can often jump or gap on a surprise earnings report, or on some other news such as a lawsuit, new products, takeovers, etc.  In these cases the traders want to enter their orders early before the breakout. Even then, sometimes volume is not high enough to give any indication on whether the breakout will continue up or the bulls will run out of steam and we'll see a pullback. Some traders will place market orders near the breakout level in order to get their shares out of the stock before the price drops back to previous levels.","You usually want to use a market order for larger orders.  In a market order, you just tell the broker to execute the order immediately at the best available price (market).  So, you are in and out of the trade sooner and take greater execution risk.  If you do a lot of trade size, you would want to use a market order (because you do not want the price to move 1% away from the bid because you can't fill your order within 1 minute). On the other hand, when you place a limit order, you specify a price level that you want to buy/sell at, and the order usually does not get executed until a counter-party is willing to trade with you.  Therefore, you are more in control on the execution price."
[INST] Do you have to be mega-rich to invest in companies pre-IPO? [/INST],"No, you can buy shares in a company before an initial public offering (IPO) via a private equity fund (also known as a venture capitalist fund or VC fund). The general partners in this fund collectively make decisions about which early stage companies to invest in. If a company grows rapidly and does not need to use more equity financing (i.e. more funding via an IPO or the sale of shares to a strategic buyer), it can take 10 years or more before investors may be able to exit the deal via an investment bank or a sale to a strategic buyer. The general partner receives a fee for managing the venture capital fund, and a fraction of the profits gained by the fund. If a company does not find a company or go public, investors never see any return on their investment. Investors are typically accredited investors, or people who invest in the funds directly. Some of these investors may also be wealthy.","This is actually quite possible. I have been doing this for a few years now and I have had decent results. What the company is looking for is an investor who can help them in some way, if they believe you may be able to help them in some way or that you have a lot of contacts that can help then they should consider you an Angel Investor and it's possible for them to be willing to set up these kinds of deals for you. The one that I went through I invested via a Venture Capitol firm that had contacts within the company to setup the deal.  So basically I had to start contacting people within the company, and this took me more than a year to finally get to the CEO and the Chairman of the board and that is how that opportunity finally came around. Another form of doing this is to find yourself a broker that works with these kinds of investments. I have a broker that works with these kinds of investment that can help point you in the right direction. I think one thing to remember, and what I am doing at the moment is look for smaller companies with high turnover, these will have less risks and have a more likely chance of becoming an acquisition target soon."
