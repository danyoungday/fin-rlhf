"For a car, what scams can be plotted with 0% financing vs rebate?","

I was looking at a car at a dealership, and we agreed on a number. After some back and forth, I came down to a cheaper option and they agreed to the price. They then mentioned there was a $300 rebate if I financed for 36 instead of 60 months.

If I'm going to go for it for 36 months and get the deal, how would the dealer be able to steal more than 300 bucks for financing versus","

I saw a commercial last week that said a local dealer was having 0% financing, but that was not the only deal. There were at least six other ""deals"" for the same car, with and without financing.

What are such promos and how can they be plotted in terms of their real savings?

Thanks for the help.

For those of you who wonder if it might be a scam, how do you account for (I won't call them ""deals"
Why does it matter if a Central Bank has a negative rather than 0% interest rate?,"
After all, they both mean the same: your savings lose value.
Theoretically speaking, the interest rates could be negative all the way to -100%, but to avoid having to deal with such complications, we use a normal scale when speaking about this.

The idea is that if I buy something, then I transfer money and, at any time, that money can be deposited in a bank. At that point, the money is “worth” less because the price of goods is going up","It really doesn’t…

It only matters because other people are using rates like interest rates to calculate their own prices and profits.

In short, it doesn’t matter for the bank. This is not about paying for a service. This is about setting the rules of their own game.

I don’t see the bank using a negative rate as anything other than pure aggression to encourage people to get out of cash, and use the ‘services’ the bank offers instead.

When you sell an option without owning the underlying futures contract(s), it is often times beneficial for you. After the expiration of the option, the profits you make on the option is yours to keep. However, this can cause negative cash balances.

If one does this type of selling frequently, it can lead to negative cash balances which, depending on the terms of the"
Approximation of equity value for company in default,".

The following is the calculation:

The equity value of a company in default can be estimated based on the company’s net equity, which is equivalent to the company’s assets minus the liabilities. The calculation usually considers only the value of the company’s financial debt, i.e. the value of liabilities related to bonds issued by the issuer and bank loans. Liabilities linked to bank guarantees, insurance, and receivables discounts, as well as provisions for doubtful debts/receivables/inventories are usually not taken"
Is it true that 90% of investors lose their money?,"

No, this is not true. This myth originated from a study that was taken out of context. It said that 90% of hedge fund managers lost money, not 90% of all investors.

Pay off car loan entirely or leave $1 until the end of the loan period?,"
DAP has a car loan calculator that gives both options. I see, for example, that for a payout of 1% of the principal, the monthly cash flow increases about 2% per month, while the total cash flow decrease by 1.14% per month. But in the end one will pay off 1% (10%) less.

A bit of a paradox, because the more I increase my savings account, the greater the total cash flow I decrease. Does this really make sense?","

What do you guys think is the better financial decision?

I’m paying down my car loan and I’m tempted to pay off the loan entirely once I hit a certain amount threshold (not even half of the total loan amount in value), but it kinda scares me a bit as the monthly payment is significantly different. I believe I’m getting more of a rate discount the longer my loan is extended. For context, if I pay off the loan entirely now, my monthly payment goes down about $6.0"
Including the region where you live in your investment portfolio?,"

I have been to several real estate investment presentations by very experienced investors.  They often talk about finding good real estate bargains in economically depressed areas.

I don’t like to take investment risks that might affect my investment’s performance in the future.

Are there any rules against penalizing consumers for requesting accurate credit reporting?,"
